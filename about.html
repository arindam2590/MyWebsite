          <h3 class="section-title">About Me</h3>
          <p>I am a Ph.D. research scholar at IIIT Allahabad, specializing in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with a strong passion 
            for Artificial Intelligence, Swarm Robotics, and Collective Intelligence in Multi Agent Systems. My research focuses on designing 
            intelligent, decentralized multi agent systems for real-world applications such as search and rescue missions, defense automation, 
            and adaptive path planning.</p>
          <p>With a solid foundation in machine learning, multi-agent, and swarm simulation, I aim to bridge theoretical advances with impactful 
            solutions for national development. I am deeply motivated to contribute to cutting-edge research that strengthens the technological 
            backbone of our country.</p>
          <p>Beyond academia, I enjoy exploring diverse interests such as wildlife photography, gardening, and traveling across India‚Äîfinding 
            inspiration in nature and culture alike. I believe in continuous learning, meaningful collaboration, and using technology as a force 
            for societal good.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Vision & Motivation</h3>
          <p> At the core of my academic journey lies an insatiable curiosity to understand intelligent behavior‚Äînot just in individuals, but 
            in collectives. I am driven by the challenge of translating theoretical frameworks into scalable, real-world systems that can 
            support humanitarian missions, national security, and sustainable technological growth. </p>
          <p> I believe that collaborative innovation, grounded in ethical principles, can shape a better future. Whether it's developing 
            autonomous systems for disaster response, defence requirements or building robust learning algorithms for dynamic environments, 
            my work is guided by a vision of technology that serves nation.</p>
          <p> My motivation comes from: </p>
          <ul>  
            <li>Curiosity and continuous learning in emerging fields of AI</li>
            <li>Collaboration and teamwork that empowers shared intelligence</li>
            <li>Integrity and ethical research as the foundation of trustworthy systems</li>
            <li>Innovation for social good, aligning academic rigor with real-world needs</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="section-title">My Journey</h3>
          <p>My academic journey is a story of curiosity evolving into purpose.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>High School (10th Standard): </strong>My fascination with technology began early. During school, I developed a strong 
              interest in science and logical reasoning, which gradually nurtured my passion for problem-solving and analytical thinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior Secondary (12th Standard):</strong> I chose Science with Mathematics as my stream in higher secondary education, 
              which laid the groundwork for my interest in computers and their wide-ranging applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Bachelor‚Äôs Degree (B.Sc.):</strong> During my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to programming, algorithms, data 
              structures, and discrete mathematics‚Äîcore subjects that sparked a deeper curiosity and strengthened my love for computer science.
              This foundational phase not only enhanced my analytical thinking but also solidified my passion for exploring intelligent systems
               and computational logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Master‚Äôs Degree (M.Sc.):</strong> During my postgraduate studies, I was introduced to advanced algorithms, data 
              structures, and core concepts in computer science, which laid a strong theoretical foundation for exploring machine learning, 
              intelligent systems etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Master‚Äôs Degree (M.Tech):</strong> During my second postgraduate journey, I was introduced to classical machine learning 
              algorithms, probability theory, and robotics. This exposure sparked a deep interest in robotics and the emergent behavior of 
              multi-agent systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Ph.D. (Ongoing):</strong> At IIIT Allahabad, I‚Äôve immersed myself in the field of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning, 
              working on decentralized decision-making, swarm behavior modeling, and real-time optimization. My focus now lies in mission-critical 
              applications like UAV-based search and rescue operations and collective coordination.</li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h3 class="section-title">Beyond Research</h3>
          <p>Outside of research labs and code, I find joy and meaning in the simple, grounding elements of life.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wildlife Photography:</strong> Capturing fleeting moments in nature‚Äîespecially big cats ‚Äî connects me to the raw 
              intelligence and beauty of nature.</li>
            <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Exploring the diverse landscapes and cultures of India enriches my perspective, reminding me of the 
              human aspect behind every algorithm I build.</li>
            <li><strong>Gardening:</strong> Growing plants teaches me patience, resilience, and the interconnectedness of all living systems.</li>
